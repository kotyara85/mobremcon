<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to do presentations without renting a conference room? With
SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to show live(!) data inside your slide? With
SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to allow your audience to comment, like, vote  inside your presentation? With
SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want a tool allowing you to make a documented
decision during the meeting? And have that decision stay with your presentation and not in a separate document? With SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want a transcript of what was said during the
presentation, automatically? With SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to control presentation with your cell phone?
With SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to say “next slide” or “go to marketing slide”
and presentation magically goes to that particular slide? With SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to do presentations in a park, with audience
watching it on their cell phones? With SLITE you can!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>… and much much much more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why did we created SLITE?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It all started with me, CEO, being a DJ. Yes a DJ in
nightclubs. After I was already an established DJ, I started producing my own
events. What I liked about it was that this was an infinite medium: you could
do fashion shows, paintings, masquerades and so on. Over time my events grew
from simple DJ dancing to extravagant shows. But even that was not enough. I
was limited by the walls of the clubs where I was doing my shows.
And then I looked into the web …</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who likes trivia shows? I do. So I hang out with very very
smart people: PhDs, scientists, and just simply walking Wikipedias (and models
due to my DJ career). And with the best of them we formed our
company - SLITE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We simply got tired of all the limitation of the PowerPoint:
being forced to squeeze data into slides, waste people's time with projector setups, and not be able to do what we used to with other technologies: how many times you tried to "like" a slide? Just to tell you
how bad this problem is: it was determined that Shuttle Discovery disaster
happened because of the PowerPoint inherit notion of data condensation. Did I mention
that with SLITE you can have infinite! data per slide? People cannot deal
anymore with something that was designed in 1995 to model after the film which
you used to stick into a projector. One of our missions in SLITE is to change the
English meaning of the word “presentation”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are a small company based in Silicon Valley, California,
USA. We work hard on this product, but also want to make it fun. This might go
against any good business advice, but what we cherish the most about our product is "how cool is it"!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to inquire about a product or make a suggestion
please write to us at: info@slite.us or directly to me, Jim, at ceo@slite.us.</p>
